#  Q&A Chatbot

## üõ† Skills
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- HuggingFace 
- LangChain
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)


## üìù Overview
This project demonstrates a chatbot capable of answering user questions using advanced AI techniques. The implementation leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrates tools like HuggingFace and LangChain to enhance functionality. The methodology includes the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch contextually relevant data, ensuring more accurate and human-like responses. The following diagram shows the workflow and components of the chatbot system:

## üìñ Lessons Learned
- **Mastery of LLMs**:
	- Gained hands-on experience with RAG,  implementing language models for specific tasks.
	- Learned to balance computational efficiency with performance in NLP applications.
	
- **HuggingFace Framework**:
	- Developed proficiency in leveraging HuggingFace's pre-trained models for text generation and question-answering.
	- Explored tokenization, attention mechanisms, and parameter tuning.
	
- **LangChain Utility**:
	- Created a prompt template to structure interactions effectively.
	- Integrated external questions and context into the system to ensure accurate and context-aware responses.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
	- Applied RAG to fetch and integrate external knowledge for more robust and fact-based chatbot answers.
	- Understood the intricacies of combining retrieval systems (e.g., vector databases) with generative models.

- **Optimization**:
	- Gained experience in debugging complex workflows, especially involving multiple interdependent libraries.
	- Focused on improving runtime performance and reducing latency in generating answers.
